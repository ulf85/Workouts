\title{Berechnung der Fitness Scores}
\usage{
calculateTL(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame with the loads (after sumDays())}
}
\value{
df data.frame with calculated values for Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ATL) and Form (TSS)
}
\description{
calculate training loads (Fitness (CTL), Fatigue (ATL) and Form (TSS)) out of the single loads
}
\note{
Although the stress score acronyms are copyrighted, what they do is not too mysterious.
Fatigue is how tired you are feeling that week and Fitness is how much training youâ€™ve done over six weeks.
Put another way, Fatigue is an exponentially weighted average of load over 7 days while Fitness
is an exponentially weight average of load over 42 days. Form is the difference between Fatigue and Fitness.
