Although the stress score acronyms are copyrighted, what they do is not too mysterious.
Fatigue is how tired you are feeling that week and Fitness is how much training youâ€™ve done over six weeks.
Put another way, Fatigue is an exponentially weighted average of load over 7 days while Fitness
is an exponentially weight average of load over 42 days. Form is the difference between Fatigue and Fitness.
